# FAQ AI Agent 

The FAQ AI Bot was created to provide quick and efficient answers to common questions for students in the YWCC Capstone Class. Before the creation of the bot, students would have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours for an answer to their question on the YWCC Capstone Discord server. This bot helps eliminate waiting times for students as the bot is capable of providing answers within seconds. The bot also helps the professor and the Capstone Operations Team focus their resources in other areas of the program that need to be addressed. By using python and Google Sheets as a database, we created a FAQ Bot that can be used in Discord in order to address users frequently asked questions. The database of questions could be found here: *link me*. The Bot will have simple commands which will be described below.
